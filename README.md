## 👋Hey! I'm Light. 
Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm a high school student from New Zealand with an interest in electronic engineering. In my spare time, I mess around with software and hardware, making it do things it (probably) shouldn’t be able to, and sometimes document this. As part of that, I also run a YouTube channel centered around tech, though it's just getting started.

Feel free to have a look around my profile to see a bit more about me and what projects I’m working on! :)
