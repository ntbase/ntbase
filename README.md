# Hey! I'm Light. 👋

Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm a New Zealand-based high-school student that's interested in electronic engineering. In my spare time, I mess around with software & hardware, and make it do what it shouldn't be able to do. I also run a YouTube channel, but that's just getting started.

Feel free to have a look around my profile to see what projects I'm working on! :)
